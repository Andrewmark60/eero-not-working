This documentation outlines the essential steps involved in the eero install, including hardware requirements, setup instructions, troubleshooting, and common best practices to ensure a seamless user experience.

Before beginning the eero install, it’s important to understand how the system works. Eero uses multiple access points, referred to as “eeros,” to create a mesh network that blankets your space with Wi-Fi. Each eero device connects to others wirelessly or via Ethernet, distributing the internet signal evenly throughout the area.

The eero system typically includes:

- A main eero unit, which connects to your modem
- One or more additional eero units to extend coverage
- The eero mobile app, required for installation and configuration

The eero network is self-optimizing, meaning it automatically updates and configures itself for the best performance. However, the initial eero installation still requires careful placement and setup to achieve the desired results.

Pre-Installation Requirements
=============================

Before beginning the eero install process, make sure you have the following:

- A working internet connection via modem (cable, DSL, or fiber)
- At least one eero device (additional units for extended coverage)
- A smartphone or tablet (iOS or Android) with the eero app installed
- An active eero account, which can be created through the app
- A power outlet available for each eero unit

Make sure your modem is functioning properly before starting the eero installation. If there are existing routers connected, disconnect them unless you are placing the eero in bridge mode.

Step-by-Step Eero Install Guide
===============================

1. Unbox and Identify Components
--------------------------------

Begin by unboxing your eero units. Each box typically contains:

- One eero device
- A power adapter
- An Ethernet cable
- Basic instructions for getting started

Confirm that all parts are present and undamaged. Identify the main eero device, which will connect directly to your modem.

2. Power Down Your Modem
------------------------

Before connecting any eero device, power off your modem and wait approximately two minutes. This allows the modem to clear its memory and prepare for a new connection.

3. Connect the Main Eero
------------------------

Take the Ethernet cable provided and connect one end to your modem and the other end to the main eero’s WAN port (usually marked with a globe icon). Plug in the power adapter and wait for the eero to power on. The LED light on the eero will flash white to indicate it is ready for setup.

4. Launch the Eero App
----------------------

Open the eero mobile app on your smartphone or tablet. Sign in or create an account if you haven't already. Follow the on-screen instructions to begin the setup process. The app will detect your eero device and guide you through the connection process.

5. Name Your Network and Set Password
-------------------------------------

During the eero install process, you will be prompted to name your Wi-Fi network and set a secure password. Choose a name that is easy to identify and a strong password to ensure security.

6. Add Additional Eero Devices
------------------------------

Once the main eero is set up, you can add additional devices to extend your network. Plug each additional eero into a power outlet within range of the main unit. The app will guide you through the process of adding each device. You may be asked to name the room or location of the unit to help identify it later.

Make sure to place each unit where it can communicate effectively with other eeros. Avoid placing devices in enclosed spaces or near sources of interference.

7. Complete Setup and Test Connection
-------------------------------------

After all devices are added, the app will finalize your eero installation. It will check signal strength between units and may perform a firmware update if needed. Once setup is complete, test your internet connection and ensure all areas of your home are covered.

Placement Tips for Optimal Performance
======================================

Proper placement is essential for a successful eero install. Follow these guidelines to optimize performance:

- Place eeros on open shelves or flat surfaces, away from obstructions
- Keep units away from microwaves, cordless phones, and metal appliances
- Maintain a clear line of sight between units if possible
- Avoid placing eeros inside cabinets or drawers

A common layout includes one eero per 1,000 to 1,500 square feet, though this may vary depending on building materials and layout.

Expanding an Existing Network
=============================

If you already have an eero system and want to add more devices, the process is simple. Open the eero app and choose “Add eero” from the settings menu. Follow the same process as described earlier to connect and place the new device.

This method of expansion is particularly useful in large homes or buildings with multiple floors, where dead zones are common. The added eero units will integrate into the existing mesh network automatically.

Bridge Mode and Advanced Configurations
=======================================

By default, the eero acts as a router, creating its own network. However, in some setups—such as those involving advanced routers, firewalls, or enterprise equipment—you may wish to use bridge mode. This allows the eero to act solely as a wireless access point.

To enable bridge mode:

- Open the eero app
- Navigate to Network Settings
- Select “Advanced Settings”
- Choose “DHCP & NAT”
- Select “Bridge”

Note that enabling bridge mode will disable certain features like device tracking and usage insights.

Troubleshooting Eero Installation Issues
========================================

While most installations proceed without issues, here are some common problems and their solutions:

- **Eero not detected in app:** Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone. Try restarting the eero and app.
- **No internet connection:** Confirm that your modem is working. Try powering down both the modem and eero and restarting.
- **Slow performance:** Check the placement of each unit. Avoid obstructions and reposition if necessary.
- **LED light flashing red:** This indicates a problem with the internet connection. Check all cables and modem status.

If problems persist, try performing a factory reset on the eero unit by pressing and holding the reset button for 15 seconds until the LED flashes yellow.

Security and Updates
====================

The eero system is designed with security in mind. It automatically updates with the latest firmware, ensuring the latest security patches are applied. Users are not required to manually install updates, but notifications may appear in the app.

Additional security features include:

- WPA3 encryption
- Family profiles for device-level control
- Guest network support

Always use a strong, unique password for your network and avoid sharing it publicly.

Conclusion
==========

The eero install process is straightforward and efficient, even for users with minimal technical experience. With the right preparation and proper placement, the eero installation will provide robust, reliable Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home or office. This guide serves as a complete reference for setting up and managing your eero network, whether you're a first-time user or expanding an existing setup.

Remember that the success of an eero installation depends on thoughtful placement, following best practices, and keeping your devices up to date. With these steps, you’ll be on your way to enjoying a faster, more reliable wireless network.
