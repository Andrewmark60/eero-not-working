When your eero is not working, it’s essential first to understand the nature of the issue. Are none of your devices connecting to Wi-Fi, or is it just one device? Is your main eero unit offline, or are the satellite nodes affected? Is the problem persistent or intermittent? By answering these questions, you can narrow down the root cause and choose the most effective resolution method.

Common Symptoms of Eero Not Working
-----------------------------------

Below are some frequent symptoms users report when facing issues with their eero system:

- Eero device has a blinking red light
- Devices cannot connect to Wi-Fi
- Internet speed is significantly reduced
- Eero app shows one or more eeros as “offline”
- Constant need to reboot the modem or eero
- Trouble setting up the eero network

Each of these symptoms may point to different underlying problems, ranging from ISP issues to hardware malfunctions. The following sections explore these causes and provide step-by-step solutions.

Initial Checks
--------------

Before diving into advanced troubleshooting, perform these initial checks:

1. **Power Cycle**: Unplug your eero device, wait for 30 seconds, and plug it back in. This resets the hardware and often resolves minor glitches.

2. **Check Cables**: Ensure all Ethernet cables are securely connected. A loose cable between your modem and eero gateway could cause the system to be unresponsive.

3. **Internet Provider**: Confirm that your internet service is active. You can do this by connecting a device directly to your modem and checking for connectivity.

4. **App Status**: Open the eero app and check for any alerts or error messages. The app often provides helpful diagnostics if your eero is not working.

Troubleshooting Steps
---------------------

If your eero is still not working after the basic checks, proceed with these targeted troubleshooting steps.

Restart the Entire Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Disconnect the power from your modem and all eero devices.
2. Wait for at least one minute.
3. Power on the modem and wait for it to fully boot up.
4. Then plug in your gateway eero (the one connected to the modem).
5. Wait for it to display a solid white light.
6. Finally, power on any other eero nodes in your mesh system.

Resetting the network in this order ensures a proper handshake between your ISP and eero devices.

Recheck Network Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, network misconfiguration can result in your eero not working properly. Verify the following settings in the eero app:

- **Network Name (SSID)**: Ensure you are connected to the correct network name.
- **IP Address**: Look at the eero app to confirm your system is receiving a valid IP address from your ISP.
- **Device Limits**: Eero has a limit on the number of devices per node. If too many are connected, performance may degrade.

Update Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Outdated firmware can result in compatibility or performance issues. To check for updates:

1. Open the eero app.
2. Navigate to the Settings menu.
3. Check under Software Update.
4. If an update is available, install it and allow your devices to reboot.

Note: During firmware updates, your network may go offline briefly.

LED Light Indicators
--------------------

Eero devices use LED lights to indicate their status. Understanding these signals is vital if your eero is not working.

- **Solid White**: Everything is working normally.
- **Blinking White**: Eero is starting up.
- **Blinking Blue**: Eero is in setup mode.
- **Solid Red**: Eero is not connected to the internet.
- **Blinking Red**: Hardware issue or connection problem.

If your eero has a red light, it usually indicates a problem with connectivity or a deeper system fault. Try restarting the eero and checking the modem again.

Advanced Fixes
--------------

If none of the basic solutions work, consider these advanced troubleshooting options.

Factory Reset Eero
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A factory reset erases all settings and returns your eero to its original state. Use this only if other steps have failed.

To perform a factory reset:

1. Locate the reset button on your eero device.
2. Press and hold it for 15 seconds until the LED flashes red.
3. Release the button and wait for the device to reboot.

After the reset, set up the eero again using the mobile app.

Relocate Eero Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes physical placement can affect performance. If your eero is not working in a certain location, try moving it:

- Avoid placing it near metal objects or in enclosed areas.
- Keep it elevated and in an open area.
- Avoid interference from microwaves or cordless phones.

Split Network Bandwidth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In congested homes or offices, eero performance may decline due to bandwidth saturation. You can:

- Prioritize devices in the eero app.
- Schedule downtime for less important devices.
- Use Ethernet backhaul if possible to reduce wireless traffic.

When to Replace Eero
--------------------

If your eero is not working after all the above efforts, it may be a hardware issue. Signs that it may need replacement include:

- Frequent overheating
- Red LED persists even after resets
- Devices disconnect repeatedly
- Firmware won’t update or install

In such cases, contact customer support or consider testing with another unit if you have one available.

Best Practices to Avoid Future Issues
-------------------------------------

To minimize the chances of facing eero not working problems again, follow these best practices:

- Keep your firmware updated regularly
- Use surge protectors to avoid damage from power outages
- Periodically reboot your eero system to clear caches
- Monitor network activity through the app
- Avoid placing all eero nodes too close or too far from each other

Conclusion
----------

While it can be frustrating to find your eero not working, most issues are solvable with a structured troubleshooting approach. From simple power cycles to more complex resets and firmware updates, these steps are designed to bring your eero system back to optimal performance. By understanding the signals your device gives and using the eero app to monitor health and connectivity, you can maintain a reliable mesh Wi-Fi network in your home or workplace.

If problems persist even after trying all of these methods, it may indicate a hardware defect or incompatibility with your ISP. At that point, replacing the unit or escalating the issue with support may be the best course of action.

Remember, maintaining your eero network is not just about fixing issues when they arise, but also about proactively managing your setup to prevent common causes that result in eero not working.
